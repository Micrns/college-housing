Developing an interactive housing finder, similar to Airbnb, to help UC students to locate and find housing nearby their univerisites without the use of Facebook marketplace. 

Note: 
The project is developed in the React.js and Node.js framework while connecting to the MySQL server to collect data.
To start displaying the project in the local browser, type npm start to the frontend and backend folders to run.
Will be needing to connect your MySQL server to the index.js file in the backend file. To connect provide your local server and password and create a User information 
table within MySQL.



This project is made to make it easier for students to find housing. Currently it is only limited to UC students but will later be expanded to other universities over time.
